**Field-Scale Mapping of California Crop Water Productivity to Inform Water Management in Critically Overdrafted Groundwater Basins**

Corisa A. Wong, David B. Lobell, and Meagan S. Mauter 

California’s Crop Water Productivity (CWP) and potential water savings datasets for critically overdrafted sub-basins within the San Joaquin Valley for four crop types: almonds, grapes, walnuts, citrus.

1. CWP_shapefiles.zip — Shapefiles* of field level CWP (2016-2021) 

2. PotentialWaterSavings.zip — 4-year average (2018-2021) potential water savings shapefiles*, separated by sub-basin and crop type. Split into three zip files due to data constraints. 
- Part 1: Chowchilla, Kaweah, Eastern San Joaquin
- Part 2: Kern County, Kings
- Part 3: Merced, Mendota, Tule, Tulare Lake, Westside, Madera

3. GSA_potentialwatersavings_csv — Total potential water savings (ac-ft/acre and ac-ft) for all GSAs within the study region for the four crop types. Water savings were not calculated for sub-basins where there were fewer than 25 parcels classified as a given crop in that year. 

*For shapefiles, fields that were below given CWP percentile and/or had an orchard age that did not meet requirements resulted in null values for a given year.
